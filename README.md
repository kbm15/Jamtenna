# Jamtenna
A ham radio antenna repository for my amateur designs, based on well-known antennas.
I will provide all the 3d parts files for use in SolidWorks and stl ready to print.
Also, everything will be noted down on the report.

They are 446MHz centric antenas with swr less than 1.5, ready to use.

Have a happy jamon radio time :)
